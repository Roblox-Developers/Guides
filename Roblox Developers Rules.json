If you are requesting or looking for work, here are some tips to avoid being scammed:\n\n*1. Post to https://talent.roblox.com/*\nConsider posting on Roblox's official Talent Hub first and including a link to the job in your job posting here.\nAs an unofficial Roblox Discord server, we lack the tools necessary to protect members against Roblox-related scams. By performing transactions through the official Talent Hub, Roblox may be able to provide additional protections.\n*2. Ask for partial payment*\nConsider asking for partial payment before starting and the full amount once the work is done.\n*3. Keep the work in writing*\nConsider writing a service contract. A service contract is an agreement outlining what exactly will and will not be included in the work. This helps to avoid misunderstandings and establish what needs to be done."
